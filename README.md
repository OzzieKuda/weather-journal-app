# Weather-Journal App Project

This project uses __asynchronous code__ to __fetch data from a web API (openweathermap.org).__ The user can enter a country code, a zip code and a message which will log all the data and update the DOM based on the input.

The project is hosted on Heroku and can be checked here:
